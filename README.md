# Websites That Enforce Weak Passwords

Some website do not allow you to use strong passwords and instead insist on using weak passwords. Let's place this websites on the pillory:

* **Etihad Airways**: Passwords can only be 8-10 characters and can only begin and end with a letter or a number ([source](https://twitter.com/larsklint/status/748615185762484224))
* **Ulster Bank**: Passwords are not allowed to contain special characters ([source](https://twitter.com/michealcolhoun/status/769146251719901185))
* **Wells Fargo**: Passwords can only be 6-14 characters ([source](https://i.imgur.com/rwfiOLj.png))
